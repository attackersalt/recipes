        <h2 class="head-2">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>175g/6 oz guanciale (pancetta or block bacon), weight after skin removed </li>
            <li>2 large eggs </li>
            <li>2 egg yolks </li>
            <li>100g/3.5 oz parmigiano reggiano , finely shredded </li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>400g/14 oz spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cooking/kosher salt (for cooking pasta)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove , finely minced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="head-2">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li><strong>Guanciale</strong> – Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbonara sauce</strong> – Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook pasta</strong> – Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li>
            <li><strong>Reserve pasta water</strong> – Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook guanciale</strong> – While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed – as the guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Pasta in pan</strong> – Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix pasta in sauce</strong> – Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong> – Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li>
